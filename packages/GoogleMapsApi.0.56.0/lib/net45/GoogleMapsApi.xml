            <summary>
            True to indicate that request comes from a device with a location sensor, otherwise false. 
            This information is required by Google and does not affect the results.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            It is unclear if Google refers to the device performing the request or the source of the location data.
            In the geocoding API reference at https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/ the definition is:
            
                sensor (required) — Indicates whether or not the geocoding request comes from a device with a location sensor.
            
            This implies that only mobile devices that are equipped with a location sensor (such as GPS) should set the Sensor value 
            to True. So if a location is sent to a web server which then calls the Google API, it apparently should set the Sensor
            value to false, since the web server isn't a location sensor equipped device.
            
            In another page of their documentation, https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial they say:
            
                The sensor parameter of the URL must be included, and indicates whether this application uses a sensor (such as a GPS 
                locator) to determine the user's location.
            
            This implies something completely different, that the Sensor value must be set to true if the source of the location
            information is a sensor or not, regardless if the request is being performed by a location sensor equipped device or not.

            The Elevation API provides elevation data for all locations on the surface of the earth, including depth locations on the ocean floor (which return negative values). In those cases where Google does not possess exact elevation measurements at the precise location you request, the service will interpolate and return an averaged value using the four nearest locations.
            With the Elevation API, you can develop hiking and biking applications, mobile positioning applications, or low resolution surveying applications.
            You access the Elevation API through an HTTP interface Users of the Google JavaScript API V3 may also access this API directly by using the ElevationService() object. (See Elevation Service for more information.)
            The Elevation API is a new service; we encourage you to join the Maps API discussion group to give us feedback.

            The Google Places API is a service that returns information about a "place" (hereafter referred to as a Place) — defined within this API as an establishment, a geographic location, or prominent point of interest — using an HTTP request. Place requests specify locations as latitude/longitude coordinates.
            Two basic Place requests are available: a Place Search request and a Place Details request. Generally, a Place Search request is used to return candidate matches, while a Place Details request returns more specific information about a Place.
            This service is designed for processing place requests generated by a user for placement of application content on a map; this service is not designed to respond to batch of offline queries, which are a violation of its terms of use.

            <summary>
            The Google Places API is a service that returns information about a "place" (hereafter referred to as a Place) — defined within this API as an establishment, a geographic location, or prominent point of interest — using an HTTP request. Place requests specify locations as latitude/longitude coordinates.
            Two basic Place requests are available: a Place Search request and a Place Details request. Generally, a Place Search request is used to return candidate matches, while a Place Details request returns more specific information about a Place.
            This service is designed for processing place requests generated by a user for placement of application content on a map; this service is not designed to respond to batch of offline queries, which are a violation of its terms of use.

            Styled maps allow you to customize the presentation of the standard Google map styles, changing the visual display of such elements as roads, parks, and built-up areas to reflect a different style than that used in the default map type. These components are known as features and a styled map allows you to select these features and apply visual styles to their display (including hiding them entirely). With these changes, the map can be made to emphasize particular components or complement content within the surrounding page.
            A customized "styled" map consists of one or more specified styles, each indicated through a style parameter within the Static Map request URL. Additional styles are specified by passing additional style parameters. A style consists of a selection(s) and a set of rules to apply to that selection. The rules indicate what visual modification to make to the selection.

Gammas modify the lightness of hues in a non-linear fashion, while unaffecting white or black values. Gammas are typically used to modify the contrast of multiple elements. For example, you could modify the gamma to increase or decrease the contrast between the edges and interiors of elements. Low gamma values (less than 1) increase contrast, while high values (> 1) decrease contrast.

            The Google Static Maps API returns an image (either GIF, PNG or JPEG) in response to a HTTP request via a URL. 
            For each request, you can specify the location of the map, the size of the image, the zoom level, the type of map, 
            and the placement of optional markers at locations on the map. You can additionally label your markers using alphanumeric 
            characters, so that you can refer to them in a "key."

            (required if markers not present) defines the center of the map, equidistant from all edges of the map. 
            This parameter takes a location as either a comma-separated {latitude,longitude} pair (e.g. "40.714728,-73.998672") or 
            a string address (e.g. "city hall, new york, ny") identifying a unique location on the face of the earth.

            <summary>
             (required if markers not present) defines the zoom level of the map, which determines the magnification level of the map. 
            This parameter takes a numerical value corresponding to the zoom level of the region desired.
            Maps on Google Maps have an integer "zoom level" which defines the resolution of the current view. Zoom levels between 0 (the lowest zoom level, in which the entire world can be seen on one map) to 21+ (down to individual buildings) are possible within the default roadmap maps view.
            Google Maps sets zoom level 0 to encompass the entire earth. Each succeeding zoom level doubles the precision in both horizontal and vertical dimensions. More information on how this is done is available in the Google Maps API documentation.
            Note: not all zoom levels appear at all locations on the earth. Zoom levels vary depending on location, as data in some parts of the globe is more granular than in other locations.
            If you send a request for a zoom level in which no map tiles exist, the Static Maps API will return a blank image instead.

            This parameter takes a string of the form valuexvalue where horizontal pixels are denoted first while vertical pixels are 
            denoted second. For example, 500x400 defines a map 500 pixels wide by 400 pixels high. 
            If you create a static map that is 100 pixels wide or smaller, the "Powered by Google" logo is automatically reduced in size.

            Which format you use depends on how you intend to present the image.

            <summary>
            Images may be returned in several common web graphics formats: GIF, JPEG and PNG. The format parameter takes one of the following values:
            png8 or png (default) specifies the 8-bit PNG format.
            png32 specifies the 32-bit PNG format.
            gif specifies the GIF format.
            jpg specifies the JPEG compression format.
            jpg-baseline specifies a non-progressive JPEG compression format.
            jpg and jpg-baseline typically provide the smallest image size, though they do so through "lossy" compression which may degrade the image. gif, png8 and png32 provide lossless compression.
            Most JPEG images are progressive, meaning that they load a coarser image earlier and refine the image resolution as more data arrives. This allows images to be loaded quickly in webpages and is the most widespread use of JPEG currently. However, some uses of JPEG (especially printing) require non-progressive (baseline) images. In such cases, you may want to use the jpg-baseline format, which is non-progressive.
